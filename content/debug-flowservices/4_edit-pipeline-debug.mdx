title: "Modify pipeline values"

While debugging, you can modify the contents of the pipeline by clicking on the field values as shown below.
The changed values are not applied on the current step but on successive steps when you do a **Step over** or **Resume**.

You can modify the pipeline data only during an active debug session.
When you modify values in the pipeline, the changes apply only to the current debug session.
You can modify existing variables but cannot add new variables to the pipeline.

Please note you may have to click outside the textbox after editing, to apply the changes to  modified pipeline value
