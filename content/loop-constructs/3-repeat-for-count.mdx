`Repeat for Count` specifies the maximum number of times FlowService re-executes the child steps in the Repeat step. 

## Repeat for Count
This control takes one input parameter:
* Input field

The **input field** can be a fixed/constant value or a field.  
If the *count* is set to any value > 0, the `Repeat for Count` step re-executes the child steps up to this number of times.  

Children of a Repeat step always execute at least once. The *count* property specifies the maximum number of times the children can be re-executed. The concept is the same as Repeat for each. The only difference here is that you iterate for a specific count. It can be specified directly on a step or through a variable (I/O or Pipeline).

## How to give fixed/constant value?
* Add `Repeat for Count` control and enter an **'integer'** as shown below:
![Select constant value](../assets/loop-constructs/repeat_for_count_select_constant_value.gif)

## How to use a field?
* Add `Repeat for Count` control and click on the **input dropdown** to open the dropdown.
* The dropdown shows a list of fields available. You can also add fields from [I/O panel](/define-io/1_adding_fields).
* Click on one the values from dropdown to select a field.

**Note**: Only fields with type **'String'** are supported for input field in `Repeat for Count`.

## Know the number of re-executions
This control uses a field **'$retries'** which contains the number of re-executions of its children steps.

## Example 1: Repeat for a specific count 5
<FlowService
description="The above flow steps keeps appending a string for 6 times and prints it."
textToCopy={repeatCount5JSON}>
  <FlowStep comment="" img="loop-constructs/repeat_count.png"/>
</FlowService>

## Example 2: Repeat using a field

<FlowService
description="The above flow steps keeps appending a string for given times (count + 1) and prints it."
textToCopy={repeatDynamicCountJSON}>
  <FlowStep comment="" img="loop-constructs/repeat_count_1.png"/>
</FlowService>
