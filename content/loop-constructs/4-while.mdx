While loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iterations are not fixed, it is recommended to use the While loop.

## Example overview - Print 'Hello world'
<FlowService
title="Print 'Hello world' a given number of times with while"
description="The above flow steps keeps appending a string while the value of x is less than 5 and keeps incrementing that value at each iteration and finally prints it."

</FlowService>

## Example description - Print 'Hello world'
1) Add inputs as shown below:
![Add inputs](../assets/loop-constructs/while_input.png)

2) Add a `While` step and add condition as shown:

![Add condition](../assets/loop-constructs/while_condition.gif)

## Code snippet:
```
  String output = "";
  while (x  < 5) {
    output = output.concat("---Hello World---");
    x++;
  }
  System.out.println(output);
```
