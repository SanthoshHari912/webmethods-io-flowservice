title: "View previous execution results"

---
As a user, when we test a FlowService with different sets of input values, it will be easier if there is an option to check the previous outcomes either to ensure all usecases have been verified or  for comparing the results or for  other user specific requirements.
We have a provision in **Results Panel** to view previous results.

We have a dropdown in the top right corner of **Results Panel** to view the previous results.
The dropdown appears only when the FlowService has been executed more than once.

Click on any entry in the previous results dropdown to check the respective results. The results are retained for a maximum period of one month.

**Note** : Only the FlowService executions through UI invocation will be listed in previous dropdown. Results of FlowServices execution via Scheduler or other invocation mechanisms will not be listed here.
