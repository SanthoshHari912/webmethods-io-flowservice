In this section, we will see creating Input output signature by manual insertion.

## How  to define a field ?
On the Input tab, you define the variables that the FlowService requires as input.<br/>
On the Output tab, you define the variables that the FlowService returns to the client or calling program.

Click on the plus icon in the toolbar to add the new field. Once the field is added, enter the field details.
If you select the Type as 'String', select 'Text field' in the Display Type field, if you want the input entered in a text field.
Select 'Password' if you want the input entered as a password.
Select Large Editor if you want the input entered in a large text area instead of a text field.
This is useful if you expect a large amount of text as input for the field, or you need to have new line characters in the input.
In the Pick List field, define the values that will appear as choices when integration prompts for input at run time.
