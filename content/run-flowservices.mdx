title: "Run FlowServices"

---
Once we have defined  input and output for a FlowService, completed implementing the  steps and their  mappings as per our requirement,
 we need to test the flowService execution.

 Please note when you try to run a FlowService, if there are any new changes then it will be autosaved before executing it.

 In this section, we will check how to run a FlowService and some useful tips / artifacts that help us in testing the FlowService.
