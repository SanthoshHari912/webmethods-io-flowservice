The selected fields can be dropped from the pipeline.

If any output field is dropped, then that particular field is not flown as input to the next step.
This way, user can restrict the flow of fields from one step to another.

In the above example, since **_num1_** and **_num2_** are dropped in step 1, all the other are flow to the step2 as input, except these two fields.
