Before looking in depth,lets get started with what actually Pipeline means

# What is pipeline?

The pipeline refers to the data structure in which input and output values are maintained for a FlowService.
The pipeline starts with the input to the FlowService and collects inputs and outputs from subsequent Connectors and services in the FlowService.
When an operation of a Connector or a FlowService executes, it has access to all data in the pipeline at that point.

To open a pipeline panel, any operation of connector/service is to be selected and account to be configured (in case of connector).
The FlowService would generate the fields based on the operation and the service. User can define IO fields and map them to the service's fields.

lets take the usecase of **_adding integers_** using **_Math service._** This use case will be used to illustrate all features of pipeline further in this section.

<FlowService

description = " A flow step is created initially, without any data manipulation "

  <FlowStep comment="AddInts operation is chosen from Math service" img="pipeline/add-ints-step.png"/>
</FlowService>

Lets see each of its functionality in detail
